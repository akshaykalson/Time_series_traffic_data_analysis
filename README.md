# Time Series Traffic Data Analysis

This project involves predictive analysis and visualization of traffic patterns using time series forecasting techniques applied to the Metro Interstate Traffic Volume dataset.

## Overview

- **Objective:** Understand and predict traffic volume patterns over time.
- **Techniques:** Time series forecasting, visualization, and interpretability analysis using SHAP values.

## Project Structure

- **Notebooks:** Jupyter notebooks for data analysis, modeling, and interpretation.
- **Data:** Dataset (`Metro_Interstate_Traffic_Volume.csv`) containing traffic-related features.
- **Visualizations:** Plots and charts illustrating traffic trends and model interpretability.

## Key Features

- **Time Series Decomposition:** Explore seasons, trends, and patterns in traffic volume.
- **Machine Learning Modeling:** Apply time series forecasting models for predictive analysis.
- **Interpretability Analysis:** Use SHAP values to understand feature importance in decision tree predictions.
